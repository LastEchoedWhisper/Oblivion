#all list of outcomes in answer variation, thanks to Andrew
outcome_2a = "You awaken strapped to a chair, observing the room you see massive glass tubes with humans floating \
within them. You struggle against the restraints for a while then they become undone. You walk towards a control center \
with many buttons and flashing lights; you have no idea how to operate the controls so you look for labels but find none. \
You have the choice from pushing some of the five most appealing buttons."

outcome_2b = "You enter a room with a door that has a small thick glass window. As you inspect the room you notice a lever \
with two buttons next to it; a green button atop of a red button."

outcome_2c = "You enter a room with shelves lining the walls each full of dials. Each shelf has strange dots and lines next \
to them; you presume that these dots and dashes are labels. You have no idea what the vials do or what they are for."

outcome_2a_green = "The instant you press the button you hear a strange sound, as you look for the source of the sound \
you realize the vents are making a strange noise. You feel lightheaded and head towards the door in order to get a breath \
of fresh air; the door is locked. Your vision blurs as it fades to black." #user dies and restarts game

outcome_2a_yellow = "An alarm reverberates throughout the room, yellow lights flash in two second intervals. The sound \
of rushing water can be heard, in your panic you leave through a door past all of the glass tubes. Entering a large room \
full of strange vials which line the walls." #leads to outcome 2c

outcome_2a_red = "You push the button, nothing happens." #removes option but leaves other open

outcome_2a_blue = "You hear a clicking sound then a door past the glass tubes opens." #leads to outcome 2c

outcome_2a_white = "You notice the lights on the control panel fade and flicker into darkness, the lights in the room \
progressively dim; your only source of light is the glass tubes containing the floating human bodies. As you examine the \
bodies you notice different tubes going into them. You eventually bore of examining the bodies in the glass tubes and \
attempt to leave through the door you came from, the door is locked. Hours pass and the lights illuminating the glass \
tubes slowly flicker out of existence. Trapped in complete darkness you slowly wait for rescue. A sound is heard \
immediately followed by complete silence; days pass by as you are trapped in the cold dark room. You can’t feel your \
arms or your legs. Who are you? Are you even alive?" #user dies LUL

outcome_2c_novial = "You decide that the vials are ominous and most likely lethal; you walk out of the room so that your \
curiosity doesn’t get the best of you."

outcome_2c_poison = "You grab a vial and immediately drink the contents within. The liquid within the vial is sweet and as \
it goes down your throat you feel a slow pain emanating from your stomach. You collapse onto the floor as a burning \
sensation spreads throughout your body. All of the shimmering vials slowly fade to black as you breathe your last breaths."

outcome_2c_language = "You grab a vial and immediately drink the contents within. The liquid within the vial is sour and \
it burns as it goes down your throat. Your vision wanes as you close your eyes; an intense shearing pain spreads through \
your head. You collapse onto the floor; you truly believe you are dying. The throbbing pain slowly lessens until it is gone. \
You walk out of the room regretting having drunk whatever was within the vial."

outcome_2c_tech = "You grab a vial and immediately drink the contents within. The liquid within the vial is bland and \
metallic. As the liquid travels down your throat you feel a searing hot sensation and the liquid feels viscous as it \
slowly slithers down your throat. Your head begins to throb, your forehead burns and aches. You stumble out of the room, \
regretting having drunk what was in the vial as you massage your forehead in an attempt to quell the pain."

outcome_2c_endurance = "You grab a vial and immediately drink the contents within. The liquid within has no taste; you \
assume you just drank water. You feel refreshed and energetic. You stroll out of the room."

outcome_2c_strength = "You grab a vial and immediately drink the contents within. The liquid within is bitter and it makes \
you gag and cough. You compose yourself and walk out of the room ready to take on whatever comes your way."
